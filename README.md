## Overview
**API City** is an educational game designed to teach players how API requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) work in a real-world simulation. Players will explore a virtual city, complete missions using API calls, and learn about authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.

---

## Features

### Interactive City Environment
- Players explore a vibrant, interactive city where every building and system is tied to an API.

### Mission-Based Learning
- Players are tasked with completing missions using different HTTP methods, like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Simulation of API Calls
- Players perform API requests to interact with the virtual environment, learning through hands-on experience.

### Dialogue Box
- Continuous messages are displayed dynamically for the player in each scene.

### Progressive Difficulty
- The complexity of the tasks increases as the player progresses through different scenes, simulating real-world use cases of API calls.
